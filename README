This is a simple python application for transcoding video into formats
supported by GStreamer. 

It depends on the following libraries:
GStreamer-1.x
GStreamer Plugins Base 1.x
GStreamer Plugins Good 1.x
Gtk3
Glib2
Python3
notify-python
python3-gobject
xdg-user-dirs-gtk

Strongly recommended:
GStreamer Plugins Ugly 1.x
GStreamer Plugins Bad 1.x
GStreamer libav 1.x

Recommended for DVD support:
lsdvd
libdvdread
libdvdcss


Transmageddon should work with any properly implemented codec plugins out
there, be that hardware plugins or proprietary ones, but I can make no promises
as I am not able to test them. But if you have problems please get in touch.
