This is a simple python application for transcoding video into formats
supported by GStreamer. 

It depends on the following libraries:
GStreamer
GStreamer Plugins Base
GStreamer Plugins Good
Gtk
Glib
Python
notify-python
pygobject2

Strongly recommended:
GStreamer Plugins Ugly
GStreamer Plugins Bad
GStreamer libav

Transmageddon should work with any properly implemented codec plugins out
there, be that hardware plugins or proprietary ones, but I can make no promises
as I am not able to test them. But if you have problems please get in touch.
