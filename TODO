* Make codec choices intelligent
  Currently the choice of codecs you get with each container format is chosen by hand. We should query
  the GStreamer caps and choose them automatically based on that. This needs a bit of thinking though,
  as we also want easy codec install to work.

* Not hardcode encoder and muxer plugin names
  Let GStreamer just provide us any plugin it got available which can encode or mux to wanted format
  instead of hardcoding plugin names in the code. This is probably also needed to get easy_codec to work.

* Support setting attributes on the encoders
  This will allow us to choose Dirac Pro as a codec for instance as that is an attribute on the 
  normal Dirac encoder. This is also needed for good Apple support as the AAC decoder needs to be
  set to LC profile instead of Main for iPods etc.

* Enable support for MXF and DNxHD. Once the MXF muxer is in gst-plugins-bad we can enable support for
  MXF container format and DNxHD video codec.

* ASF support. Summer of code will hopefully provide us with a ASF muxer. This would enable all Windows
  media formats.

* Add profiles
  I want to have profiles for things like N810, iPhone, PSP etc. which automatically choose a 
  container format and codecs for you. This would ideally be combined with a videoscaling, which 
  in turn require us to get GStreamer to probe the file upon selection so we can make some 
  decisions on if and how to scale. Short term I will just add a few 'hardcoded' profiles, 
  but long term I want to look at the banshee stuff and the Gstreamer preset interface to 
  see what we can do.
  
* Enable translations
  Allow translators to translate the application using po files.

* Add better error handling
  Make sure the application runs even if directory names etc. are different. Enable reporting when
  no plugin is found which allows allows muxing or encoding. Verify that Easy Codec install works.

* And status field which lets user know that file is done and where it ended up.

* Get application icon made
  Find a graphics artist to make nice Tango style icon

* Support remuxing 
  Allow incoming codecs to be preserved and just remuxed into new file when possible

* Support non-muxed audio codec 
  Allow the outputting of non-muxed audio codecs (mp3 mostly). Not sure we really want this as 
  it would add more options to the UI to do something which I doubt a lot of people care to use 
  this application for.

* More advanced features
  There are many things people might want to do. We want to avoid this application becoming like a lot of
  other transcoder tools though, which got more buttons and options that you can throw a stick at. 
  Never expose an option which a 'normal' user is unlikely to understand and want to tweak. 
  One example of something we *might* want to add is downmixing of audio channels.

* Move more logic out of UI file
  The gstreamer buswatch stuff is moved into the engine, but the query code still requrie a import gst in  the UI.

* Windows port
  Port application to windows and get a py2exe binary going with everything. The video directory stuff 
  is only known current non-portable.

* The UI do not offer AMR support atm, which could be useful for 3GPP files. Problem is that there is 
  no proper AMR plugin for GStreamer, the one in 'ugly' is never built as it requires some code 
  which there is a lot of uncertainty about whether can be distributed. Added GSoC proposal for 
  AMR plugins.

* DVD input support
  Maybe it would be nice to allow DVDs to be the input. Could probably look at Thoggen for how to do that. Not sure we
  can do it without a lot of extra UI though.

* Add an audio denoise filter
  Audio can be filtered with an audio filter to remove noise.

* Include a download script plug-in section
  For scripts that can download videos from sites like YouTube.com.
