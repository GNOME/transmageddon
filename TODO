This list is completely unordered. Nothing about the ordering in this list should cause anyone to make any kind of assumptions about priorties.

* More advanced features
  There are many things people might want to do. We want to avoid this application 
  becoming like a lot of other transcoder tools though, which got more buttons 
  and options that you can throw a stick at. Never expose an option which a 
  'normal' user is unlikely to understand and want to tweak. One example of 
  something we *might* want to add is downmixing of audio channels.

* Move more logic out of UI file
  The gstreamer buswatch stuff is moved into the engine, but the query code still 
  requrie a import gst in  the UI.

* Windows port
  Port application to windows and get a py2exe binary going with everything. The video
  directory stuff is only known current non-portable.

* Add an audio denoise filter
  Audio can be filtered with an audio filter to remove noise.

* Include a download script plug-in section
  For scripts that can download videos from sites like YouTube.com.

* Add testing for relevant gstreamer versions to have needed plugins etc.

* Add some checking on input, making sure its valid and a audio+video file

* remove status message when people choose new codec combo if codec download fails

* Add a lot of testing for the data coming from the XML profiles. People can currently 
  hang the application quite easily by feeding it non-valid data through the XML profiles.

* Profiles generator
  Would be great to create something which analyzed a media file and created a profile to 
  match it. 
  
* Subtitles
  Support muxing in Subtitles into AVI and MPEG4 files. Need GStreamer work 
  for it to happen. Support encoding subtitles as part of the video image.

* Add thumbnail support
  Automatically create a jpeg thumbnail for devices such as the PSP

* DVB integration with DVB-daemon
  i) interface with gnome-dvb-daemon so could live transcode dvb, 
  ii) montior directory and transcode to multiple devices when files 
      turn up in directory
  iii) start transcode once dvb-daemon says recording is done

* AVC HD support.
  Variation of MPEG TS with H264 and AC3 audio

* Batch transcoding - multiple files 'programmed up front'

* Error handling - handle case where discoverer fail

* Check if videoflip element actually is installed (in case only base and core is installed)

* Add support for turning a video into images and a directory of images into video

* Fix DVD ac3 remuxing
