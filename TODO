This list is completely unordered. Nothing about the ordering in this list should cause anyone to make any kind of assumptions about priorties.

* More advanced features
  There are many things people might want to do. We want to avoid this application 
  becoming like a lot of other transcoder tools though, which got more buttons 
  and options that you can throw a stick at. Never expose an option which a 
  'normal' user is unlikely to understand and want to tweak. One example of 
  something we *might* want to add is downmixing of audio channels.

* Move more logic out of UI file
  The gstreamer buswatch stuff is moved into the engine, but the query code still 
  requrie a import gst in  the UI.

* Windows port
  Port application to windows and get a py2exe binary going with everything. The video
  directory stuff is only known current non-portable.

* DVD input support
  Maybe it would be nice to allow DVDs to be the input. Could probably look at Thoggen 
  for how to do that. Not sure we can do it without a lot of extra UI though.

* Add an audio denoise filter
  Audio can be filtered with an audio filter to remove noise.

* Include a download script plug-in section
  For scripts that can download videos from sites like YouTube.com.

* Add testing for relevant gstreamer versions to have needed plugins etc.

* Add some checking on input, making sure its valid and a audio+video file

* remove status message when people choose new codec combo if codec download fails

* Add a lot of testing for the data coming from the XML profiles. People can currently 
  hang the application quite easily by feeding it non-valid data through the XML profiles.

* Profiles
  These work now, but it is clear that unless we want a 1 million item drop down list we 
  need to set up some kind of online repository where people can search and download the
  profiles they need. Should be done in collaboration with Arista.

* Subtitles
  Support muxing in Subtitles into AVI and MPEG4 files. Need GStreamer work 
  for it to happen. Support encoding subtitles as part of the video image.

* Add thumbnail support
  Automatically create a jpeg thumbnail for devices such as the PSP

* DVB integration with DVB-daemon
  i) interface with gnome-dvb-daemon so could live transcode dvb, 
  ii) montior directory and transcode to multiple devices when files 
      turn up in directory
  iii) start transcode once dvb-daemon says recording is done

* AVC HD support.
  Variation of MPEG TS with H264 and AC3 audio

* Support multiple audio tracks. Probably want to wait for new discoverer for that.

* Batch transcoding - multiple files 'programmed up front'
